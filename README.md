# MST_Evolutionary-Algorithm
This Genetic Algorithm is used to minimize a McCormick funtion by reducing "cost".

Here we are generating a random MST tree to be used as an example.

This file showcases the use of Genetic Algorithm in reducing cost, this algorithm is phenotype as opposed to genotype oriented, this is because the McCormick function result is a direct phenotype used in fitness evaluation accross generations.
